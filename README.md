# Gradient Descent and Cost Function

This is assignment code for concept of  gradient descent and cost function on linear regression with example.It is also described on how important role on mean sqaure error ( cost function ) for best performance of models.

  - Dependent value and Independent value
    
    y = b + mx  
     
     where b is intercept,
           m is slope,
           x is indepedent value
           y is dependent value

  - Mean Squared Error or cost funct

    mse = 1/n âˆ‘ Yi - (mXi + b)
